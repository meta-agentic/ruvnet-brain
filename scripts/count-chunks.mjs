// scripts/count-chunks.mjs — recount the REAL passage total across the local PUBLIC kb stores and
// restamp it onto every public surface that advertises it. Rule: no number beats a wrong number —
// the hand-typed "129,685 source chunks" rotted (SOURCE.json advertised a corpus that had moved on)
// and was pulled from every surface in v3.2.5. This script is how it comes back honestly: computed
// fresh from disk every time, never hand-typed again.
//
// NOTHING is duplicated here — neither the counting nor the restamping. Both live in
// claims-verify.mjs (`applyFix`), the same module whose `verifyChunkCountSurfaces` gates the result,
// and this file is a thin CLI over it. That is deliberate: a second writer with its own regexes is
// how four surfaces drift four ways in the first place. Private stores (kb/PRIVATE-STORES.json) are
// fenced out by the shared counter, so the public number can never include private content.
//
// A surface with NO existing "N chunks" claim (e.g. explainer/index.html before this was restored)
// is reported, not silently improvised into someone else's prose — the first stamp on a new surface
// is a deliberate one-time copy edit, done by hand once; after that this script keeps it fresh.
//
// Usage:  node scripts/count-chunks.mjs            # recount + write the fresh census into every surface
//         node scripts/count-chunks.mjs --check     # report only; exit 1 if any surface would change
//
// `npm run claims:fix` does this AND the coverage badge in one pass; prefer it. This entry point
// stays because the nightly brain rebuild wants the census restamped without touching coverage.
