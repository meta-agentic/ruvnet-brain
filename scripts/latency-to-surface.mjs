/**
 * latency-to-surface.mjs — the metric ADR-028 calls "the single best summary metric", finally measured.
 *
 * ADR-028:103 defines it: "time between a capability becoming dormant and the user being told."
 * Target "hours, not weeks", against a 21-day baseline that the ADR says "this whole project exists
 * to destroy." An independent grader on 2026-07-24 charged -6 against the Proactive pillar for it,
 * with a fair description: the 21-day baseline was still prose. Nothing recorded when a capability
 * went dormant, so nothing could subtract.
 *
 * WHY IT COULD NOT BE COMPUTED BEFORE, and what actually had to be built. The advocacy ledger already
 * records when we SPOKE (`action:'offered'`, with an `at`). That is one end of the subtraction. The
 * other end — when the capability BECAME dormant — existed nowhere, because the registry is a pure
 * detector: it reports the state it observes right now and keeps no history. A detector with no
 * memory can say "this is off"; it can never say "this has been off since Tuesday."
 *
 * So this file adds the missing half: an append-only log of capability state TRANSITIONS.
 *
 * ONLY TRANSITIONS, and that is a correctness decision rather than a disk-space one. If every
 * observation were appended, "when did it become dormant" would depend on how often the console
 * happened to be opened — a capability observed hourly would look freshly dormant, and the same
 * capability observed weekly would look dormant for a week, from identical facts. Recording only
 * changes makes the onset a property OF THE CAPABILITY rather than of our sampling schedule.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS DORMANT — off and idle only.
 *   off     → present and not running. Dormant.
 *   idle    → set up, proven, nothing calling it. Dormant, and the state this product exists for.
 *   absent  → NOT dormant. It was never installed; there is nothing lying unused.
 *   unknown → NOT dormant. We could not establish the state, and "we could not tell" must never be
 *             silently converted into "it is off" — that is the fabrication this repo's registry
 *             rule exists to prevent, and it would inflate the metric with invented dormancy.
 *
 * THE HONEST NULL. With no history, every latency is `null`, never `0`. A fresh install has not
 * achieved instant surfacing; it has no measurement at all, and the difference is the whole
 * difference between this product and one that lies. `summarize()` reports `measured: 0` in that
 * case and every caller must render it as "not measured yet".
 *
 * THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS MOST is not the average of what we surfaced — it is `stillDark`: things
 * dormant right now that we have NEVER told the user about, with their clocks still running. A
 * project that only averages its successes reports a beautiful latency while a capability quietly
 * rots. Those are counted separately and never folded into the mean.
