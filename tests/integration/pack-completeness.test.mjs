/**
 * pack-completeness.test.mjs — what bin/install.mjs IMPORTS must be what `npm pack` SHIPS.
 *
 * RED, verbatim (origin/main b73176a, `npm pack --dry-run --json`):
 *
 *     files: 21
 *     MISSING   scripts/install-scope.mjs
 *     MISSING   scripts/selfcheck.mjs
 *     MISSING   scripts/upgrade-notice.mjs
 *
 * Every dynamic import bin/install.mjs makes was absent from package.json `files[]`. The installer's
 * three post-install blocks therefore could not run on a real npm install — including
 * scripts/selfcheck.mjs, which had merged the previous day as "the post-install self-check (D8) — the
 * installer can finally FAIL". It could not fail; it was not there. And a comment inside install.mjs
 * asserted the opposite in plain words ("shipped in package.json `files`"), written from intent and
 * never checked against `npm pack` — which is the whole reason this file derives the list from the
 * source instead of restating it.
 *
 * The list is DERIVED, never hardcoded: a fourth dynamic import added tomorrow is covered the moment
 * it is written, without anyone remembering this file exists.
