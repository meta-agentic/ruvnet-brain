// tests/unit/no-silent-substitution.test.mjs — tests for the gate that catches the worst class of bug
// this project has produced: passing my own code off as rUv's.
//
// THE INCIDENT (2026-07-13): I wrote a 216-line model router with a self-described "placeholder
// policy" and SKILL.md called it "the MetaHarness router engine". @metaharness/router@0.3.2 — rUv's
// REAL learned cost-optimal router (ADR-040/043, Accepted/implemented) — was already on npm. Every
// unit test passed. Every CI gate was green. Nothing asked the only question that mattered:
// "does rUv already ship this, and am I wearing his name?"
//
// A gate with no tests is a script nobody trusts, so: these pin BOTH directions — it must FIRE on a
// substitution, and it must STAY SILENT on legitimate code. A gate that cries wolf gets switched off
// (the windows-unit lesson), and a gate that misses the crime is decoration.
