//
// EVERY sibling module bin/install.mjs imports must actually be IN THE PUBLISHED TARBALL.
//
// This gate exists because the same defect shipped four times, silently, and was only ever found
// by accident:
//
//   - scripts/install-scope.mjs   — install.mjs's OWN comment already said it "is not in files[]
//                                   — so on a real npm install it silently never runs"
//   - scripts/selfcheck.mjs       — found 2026-07-27 while fixing something else. install.mjs:1135
//                                   asserts "selfcheck.mjs is shipped in package.json files".
//                                   It was not. Measured on the real packed artifact:
//                                   ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. So D8 — the entire post-install
//                                   self-check feature — had NEVER RUN for a single npm user.
//                                   It worked only from a git checkout, which is the one place
//                                   nobody needed it.
//   - scripts/hook-registry.mjs   — imported by selfcheck.mjs, same gap
//   - scripts/upgrade-notice.mjs  — imported at two sites, same gap
//
// Every one of these is wrapped in a catch that degrades quietly, which is exactly why nobody
// noticed: the feature does not crash, it just is not there. A capability that silently does not
// exist on real installs is worse than one that was never built, because the team believes it is
// running and stops looking.
//
// The list is DERIVED from install.mjs by reading its actual import sites — never hand-maintained.
// A hand-written list would drift the moment someone adds an import, which is the failure mode
// this gate is supposed to end.
