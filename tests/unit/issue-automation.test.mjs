// tests/unit/issue-automation.test.mjs — the 2026-07-24 incident, pinned as regressions.
//
// Four issues (#38/#39/#41/#42) sat 28h with zero pages while the auto-fixer posted 22 public
// failure comments on #38 alone. Three mechanisms, each tested here against the exact broken
// behavior that shipped:
//   1. issue-watch counted the fixer's bot comments (posted through the owner's gh auth) as "the
//      owner responded" — silencing every SLA page.
//   2. issue-fix's attempt-start state write was a fresh object, erasing failureCommentAt each
//      run — so the failure-comment dedup NEVER operated.
//   3. No circuit breaker: a fixer that failed 20+ times kept retrying (and posting) forever.
// Every "fixed" case below has a paired known-bad assertion so the test fails on the old code —
// a guard that cannot fail on broken code is not a guard.
